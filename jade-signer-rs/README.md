NOTE:

An offline wallet, also known as cold storage, provides the highest level of security for savings.
It involves storing a wallet in a secured place that is not connected to the network (air-gapped).
When done properly, it can offer a very good protection against computer vulnerabilities.
```

Distributed as a Rust crate or can be embedded via foreign function interface (FFI).

For minimalistic CLI tool refer to [Emerald-cli](https://github.com/ethereumproject/emerald-cli), or if you looking for a fully-featured UI online wallet, take a look at our [Ethereum Classic Emerald Wallet](https://github.com/ethereumproject/emerald-wallet)

Developed by [ETCDEV Team](http://www.etcdevteam.com/)

fn main() {
    let addr = "127.0.0.1:1920"
        .parse::<SocketAddr>()
        .expect("Expect to parse address");

    emerald::start(&addr, None, None);
